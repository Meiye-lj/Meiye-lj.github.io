I completed my PhD at Nanjing University, China, supervised by [Prof. He (Jason) Zhang](https://software.nju.edu.cn//hezhang/index.html). My research focuses on improving the efficiency and quality of software development, with particular emphasis on practical challenges in software build efficiency and build reliability. More recently, my interests have expanded to software testing, security, and AI for Software Engineering (AI4SE).

**I am a research staff member at the Software Institute, Nanjing University. I am currently looking for motivated undergraduate, Master’s, and PhD students who are interested in software security, software testing, and AI for Software Engineering (AI4SE).**

An ideal candidate may have some of the following qualities:

* Strong programming and implementation skills
* A strong interest in conducting research and publishing in top-tier venues (e.g., ICSE, FSE, ISSTA)
* The curiosity and courage to take on challenging and impactful problems
* Resilience in handling setbacks (which are common in research), while maintaining a healthy work–life balance

If you are interested, feel free to reach out and send me your CV (and transcript). It would also be helpful if you could briefly explain why you are interested in joining the lab and how your background and interests align with our research.
